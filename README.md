I practice creating a compiler in Rust language, this compiler compiles .xnj files, to try the compiler, you need to download the executable file, open the command line, go to the directory or add the compiler to the path environment, and go to the directory where the file main.xnj, example of using xnjc main.xnj, and then go to the directory where the main.xnj file is located.
code example:
main{
    output("Hello World");
    Ok();
}
