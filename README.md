I practice creating a compiler in Rust language, this compiler compiles .xnj files, at the moment, only output("Hello World") works, to try the compiler, you need to download the executable file, open the command line, go to the directory or add the compiler to the path environment, and go to the directory where the file main.xnj, example of using xnjc main.xnj, and then go to the directory where the main.xnj file is located.
